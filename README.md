## Countdown

Simple web app that displays a countdown in hours, minutes and seconds. Helpful if you need to keep track of time when DJing or making presentations.

To get started, you'll need Node.js and npm installed locally.

Clone the repository and run `npm install`

`npm run dev` starts the server.

Set a start time and end time (currently only supports the same day of the week). The countdown begins at the start time. The start and end time are stored locally but if you clear your browser cache, they will be lost and you have to reset.
